# IWP-Data-Retriever
Retrieve shapefiles of IWPs predicted by MAPLE that are requested by a data user.

All the required libraries are built-in to Python's standard libraries, so no need for installs. However, you do need access to ArcGIS/QGIS in order to retrieve the list of filenames from the image footprints that intersect with an AOI that is provided by the user making a data request.
